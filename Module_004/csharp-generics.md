# C# Generics

## Introduction to Generics

Generics are a powerful feature in C# that allow you to write flexible, reusable code that can work with different types while maintaining type safety. Think of generics like a universal wrench that can adjust to fit different bolt sizes, rather than needing a separate wrench for each size.

### Why Generics Matter

Before generics, developers had two primary approaches to handling different types:
1. Using `object` type (which loses type safety)
2. Creating multiple implementations for different types

Generics solve these problems by providing a way to write type-safe, efficient code that works across multiple data types.

## Basic Generic Syntax

### Generic Methods

Let's look at a simple generic method that swaps two values of any type:

```csharp
public void Swap<T>(ref T first, ref T second)
{
    // Generic swap implementation works with any type
    T temp = first;
    first = second;
    second = temp;
}
```

In this example, `T` is a type parameter. When the method is called, `T` will be replaced with a specific type.

### Generic Classes

You can also create entire classes that work with generic types:

```csharp
public class GenericContainer<T>
{
    private T _item;

    public void Store(T item)
    {
        _item = item;
    }

    public T Retrieve()
    {
        return _item;
    }
}
```

## Constraints on Type Parameters

Sometimes, you want to limit what types can be used with a generic. C# provides type constraints:

```csharp
// Ensure T is a class
public class Processor<T> where T : class
{
    // Implementation
}

// Ensure T has a parameterless constructor
public class Factory<T> where T : new()
{
    public T CreateInstance()
    {
        return new T();
    }
}

// Multiple constraints
public void Compare<T>(T first, T second) 
    where T : IComparable<T>, new()
{
    // T must implement IComparable and have a parameterless constructor
}
```

Common constraints include:
- `where T : struct` (value types only)
- `where T : class` (reference types only)
- `where T : new()` (must have a parameterless constructor)
- `where T : BaseClass` (must inherit from a specific class)
- `where T : Interface` (must implement a specific interface)

## Real-World Example: Generic Repository Pattern

Here's a practical implementation showing generics in a data access scenario:

```csharp
public interface IRepository<T> where T : class
{
    void Add(T entity);
    T GetById(int id);
    IEnumerable<T> GetAll();
    void Delete(T entity);
}

public class UserRepository : IRepository<User>
{
    // Specific implementation for User entities
}
```

## Performance and Compilation

When you use generics, the compiler generates specialized code for each unique type used. This means:
- No performance penalty compared to specific implementations
- Type safety maintained at compile-time
- Code remains clean and reusable

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Don't overuse generics for simple scenarios
2. Be mindful of type constraints
3. Remember that value and reference types behave differently

## Recommended Learning Path

1. Practice creating simple generic methods
2. Experiment with generic classes
3. Learn and apply type constraints
4. Study standard library generic types (List<T>, Dictionary<TKey, TValue>)

## Conclusion

Generics represent a sophisticated yet powerful feature in C# that enables more flexible, type-safe, and efficient code. They are essential for modern C# development, especially in frameworks, libraries, and large-scale applications.

### Suggested Exercises

1. Create a generic stack implementation
2. Develop a generic sorting method that works with multiple types
3. Build a generic cache class with type constraints

**Pro Tip**: The more you practice with generics, the more intuitively you'll understand their power and flexibility!
